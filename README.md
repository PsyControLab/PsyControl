# 🔬 Psychiatric Control Systems Lab

## 🧠 At the Nexus of Psychiatry, AI, and Neuroscience

Welcome to our lab's GitHub page. We're dedicated to exploring psychiatric disorders through computational methods, focusing on the dynamics of human behavior and neural activity.

### Our Research:

- 🌐 **Complex Systems Analysis:** Delving into behavior and complex systems using complexity science.
- 🧬 **Neuroscience & Machine Learning:** Creating ML models based on diverse neuroscientific data.
- 🎛️ **Network Control Theory:** Innovating brain control strategies for psychiatric applications.
- 🤖 **AI in Psychiatry:** Harnessing AI to model and improve mental health care.

### Mission & Collaboration:

We aim to merge physics, neuroscience, and AI to develop models that predict and influence mental health. Collaborating with entities like The Adaptive Mind, DFG Research Unit 2107, and NCAD, we're at the forefront of computational psychiatry.
