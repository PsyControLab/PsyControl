🔬 Psychiatric Control Systems Lab @ Philipps University of Marburg

🧠 Exploring the Intersection of Psychiatry, AI, and Neuroscience

Welcome to the GitHub page of the Psychiatric Control Systems Lab, where we're pushing the boundaries of computational psychiatry. Our lab specializes in the application of advanced computational methods to understand and model the complex dynamics of human behavior, neural activity, and psychological patterns.

What We Do:

🌐 Complex Systems Analysis: Leveraging complexity science to unravel the intricacies of psychiatric disorders.
🧬 Neuroscience Meets Machine Learning: Developing cutting-edge ML models to interpret rich neuroimaging and behavioral datasets.
🎛️ Network Control Theory: Innovating control strategies for understanding and influencing brain dynamics.
🤖 AI in Psychiatry: Applying AI techniques to predict and control psychiatric phenomena.
Our Mission:
To combine the rigor of physics, the insights of neuroscience, and the power of AI to better understand and treat psychiatric disorders. We're committed to creating computational models that not only explain but also predict and influence mental health outcomes.

Collaborations:

🤝 The Adaptive Mind: Integrating AI, Medicine, and Psychology for holistic research.
🧠 DFG Research Unit 2107: Collaborating on pioneering psychiatric research.
🏥 National Center of Affective Disorders: Translational research for rapid clinical applications.
