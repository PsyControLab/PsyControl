# 🔬 Psychiatric Control Systems Lab

## 🧠 Exploring the Intersection of Psychiatry, AI, and Neuroscience

Welcome to the GitHub page of the Psychiatric Control Systems Lab. We are dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of psychiatric disorders through the lens of physics and engineering. Our research is centered around understanding and modeling the complex dynamics of human behavior, neural activity, and psychological patterns.

### What We Do:

- 🌐 **Complex Systems Analysis:** Utilizing complexity science to delve into the physics of behavior and the statistical physics of complex systems.
- 🧬 **Neuroscience Meets Machine Learning:** Crafting advanced ML models informed by diverse datasets, including mind-wandering experiments and neuroimaging.
- 🎛️ **Network Control Theory:** Developing innovative control strategies for the human brain, aiming to predict and control psychiatric dynamics.
- 🤖 **AI in Psychiatry:** Applying AI and machine learning to better model complex systems and improve neuropsychiatric care.

### Our Mission:

Our goal is to observe and interpret a minor fraction of the trajectory of select measurable variables, such as emotional states, and extrapolate inferences about the entire trajectory of all pertinent state variables. We aim to combine the rigor of physics, the insights of neuroscience, and the power of AI to create computational models that explain, predict, and influence mental health outcomes.

### Collaborations and Affiliations:

- 🤝 **The Adaptive Mind:** As associate PIs, we collaborate with scientists from AI, Medicine, and Psychology.
- 🧠 **DFG Research Unit 2107:** Working closely with principal investigators in pioneering psychiatric research.
- 🏥 **National Center of Affective Disorders (NCAD):** Engaged in highly translational research for rapid clinical applications.
